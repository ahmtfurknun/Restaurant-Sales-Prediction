# Project Description
Your task is that given historical data of daily revenue from different restaurants in Uppsala you are to predict future sales.  You are given raw unprocessed data, before you will be able to use an algorithm in scikit-learn you will have to do some processing on data field.  You are free to use any algorithm from the course or not.  Your goal in the project is to compare a number of algorithms and preprocessing methods to see how well they compare. This project is as much about feature extraction and pre-processing and machine learning
